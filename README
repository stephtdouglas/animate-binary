Generate frames that can be turned into an animated .gif or movie file showing
a binary orbiting a star, and the resultant phase curves. 

The generated image files have filenames ending in "%03d.jpg"

On Ubuntu, install libav-tools, and then the output files can be combined into
a movie using the following command:
avconv -framerate 5 -i <filebase>_%03d.jpg out.mov

On Mac, launch iMovie and create a new project. Go to iMovie -> Preferences; change Photo Placement to "Fit" and Photo Duration to 0.1s (the shortest allowed). Drag and drop all the image files into the "import media" box, then reselect them all from that box and drag them down into the bottom box. (Hit the play button to preview once all the images are loaded). To save, go to File -> Share -> File, choose your settings (I use 540p, medium quality, and faster compression), then give it a minute to export.
